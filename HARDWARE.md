# The iRobot Create platform

All of the Roomba robots have the "Open Interface" built into them. You can hack any of the models to get access to the
serial port.

The "Create" products are Roomba robots the iRobot company made just for hobbyists. The serial port is available through a
provided serial cable (and through the cargo-bay connector in the first series of "Creates").

There are two versions of the serial interface. The older models use this protocol:

Newer hardware, including the iRobot Create2 use this protocol:

  - Red: power
  - Black: ground
  - White:RX into USB port 
  - Green:TX out of USB port

On the iCreate1 data goes TO the robot on pin 1 of the cargo bay connector

The cable that came with the iCreate did not have power connected through. The wires were not connected to the plug.
But the cable from adafruit does supply power correctly.
