# iRobotCreate and Raspberry Pi

![](art/small.jpg)

The iRobotCreate is a fantastic base platform for robotics clubs and classes. The Roomba is a familiar appliance in our society today. The 
Create is a genuine refurbished Roomba robot with a serial interface port. You can use a USB-to-serial dongle to control the
robot from your computer. Or mount a raspberry pi to the robot for a stand-alone mobile brain you connect to through wifi.

Here is the official documentation, version 1 hardware (old):

Version 2 hardware (current):

## Build the Robot

[Follow this guide](HARDWARE.md) to get your robot hardware running. The guide shows how to connect a Raspberry Pi to the iCreate1 and iCreate2.
The guide includes wiring diagrams and links to buy the parts.

## Learn the Software

[Follow this link](lib) to my Python library for controlling the create robot. The guide shows how to install the software on you PC
and Raspberry Pi. It shows how to connect remotely through wifi using Putty or the Eclipse IDE.

## Web Control

[Follow this link](webcontrol) to my web remote control software. The guide shows how to run the web server on the raspberry pi and control
the robot from a browser on a mobile device (phone or tablet). This is a great platform to take to out-reach events. Put your club flyers on the
robot and drive it around the event. Invite kids to drive the robot, and talk to them about your club.

The web interface allows scripted control through drag-and-drop commands. Users can try their hand at rudimentary programming challenges.

## Programming Challenges

[Follow this link](challenges) to a list of programming challenges for the students in your club/class. Contribute your own challenges back to community through
this repository.
