# Find the Edges Badge

![](art/smallEdgesBadge.jpg)

Use the robot's sensors to detect walls and cliffs.

  - Place the robot several feet from a wall. Put a piece of tape on the floor to mark the front edge of the robot.
  - Write code to move the robot forward SLOWLY in FULL mode until it bumps the wall. Then stop the motors.
  - Read the ```Distance``` packet to get the distance traveled.
  - Use a tape-measure to find the distance from the mark on the floor to the wall.
  - Do the measurements agree?
  
  - Repeat the exercise but use the light bumper sensors.
  
  - Repeat the exercise with a smaller distance on a table. Use the cliff sensors to stop the motors.
  
  - Write code to move the robot forward in FULL mode until it is picked up. Then stop the motors.
