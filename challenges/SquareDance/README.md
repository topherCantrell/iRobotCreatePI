# The Square Dance Badge

![](art/smallSquareDanceBadge.jpg)

Program the iRobotCreate to drive in a square pattern.

  - Pick your direction -- clockwise or counterclockwise
  - Pick your forward speed and your turning speed
  - How long do you have to wait (time.sleep) for the robot to turn 45 degrees?
  - How close can you get the robot to return to its starting position?
  
Here are some things to think about and test:

  - Do your wait times depend on the driving surface -- carpet vs tile?
  - Do your times depend on your chosen speed?
  - Does the battery charge affect the wait times?
  - Do larger driving distances affect the final error?
  - What sensors could you check instead of a timed wait?
